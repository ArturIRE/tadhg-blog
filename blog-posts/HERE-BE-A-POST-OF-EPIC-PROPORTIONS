Basic routing tutorial

This tutorial is a basic introduction to routing with Express. Routing refers to determining how an application responds to a client request to a particular endpoint, which is a URI (or path) and a specific HTTP request method (GET, POST, and so on).

Each route can have one or more handler functions, which is / are executed when the route is matched.

Route definition takes the following structure app.METHOD(PATH, HANDLER), where app is an instance of express, METHOD is an HTTP request method, PATH is a path on the server, and HANDLER is the function executed when the route is matched.

This tutorial assumes that an instance of express named app is created and the server is running. If you are not familiar with creating an app and starting it, refer to the Hello world example.
The following code illustrates some example routes in an app.

// respond with "Hello World!" on the homepage
app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!');
})

// accept POST request on the homepage
app.post('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Got a POST request');
})

// accept PUT request at /user
app.put('/user', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Got a PUT request at /user');
})

// accept DELETE request at /user
app.delete('/user', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Got a DELETE request at /user');
})
